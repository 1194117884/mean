{"name":"Mean","tagline":"MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) stack Boilerplate","body":"# MEAN Stack\r\n\r\nMEAN is a boilerplate that provides a nice starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), Express, and AngularJS based applications. It is designed to give you quick and organized way to start developing of MEAN based web apps with useful modules like mongoose and passport pre-bundled and configured. We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.  \r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n* Node.js - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/). You can also follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) for a quick and easy way to install Node.js and npm\r\n* MongoDB - Download and Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) - Make sure it's running on the default port (27017).\r\n\r\n### Optional (Requirements for Grunt)\r\n* Ruby - Download and Install [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/).\r\n* Ruby Gems - Download and Install [Ruby Gems](http://rubygems.org).\r\n* Grunt - Download and Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).\r\n\r\n## Additional Packages\r\n* Express - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.\r\n* Mongoose - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.\r\n* Passport - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.\r\n* AngularJS - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.\r\n* Twitter Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.\r\n* UI Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.\r\n\r\n## Quick Install\r\n\r\n The quickest way to get started with MEAN is to clone the project and utilize it like this:\r\n\r\n  Install dependencies:\r\n\r\n    $ npm install\r\n\r\n  We recommend using [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) to start the server:\r\n\r\n    $ grunt\r\n\r\n  When not using grunt you can use:\r\n\r\n    $ node server\r\n\r\n  Then open a browser and go to:\r\n    \r\n    http://localhost:3000\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\nAll configuration is specified in the [config](config/) folder, particularly the [config.js](config/config.js) file. Here you will need to specify your application name, database name, as well as hook up any social app keys if you want integration with Twitter, Facebook, GitHub or Google.\r\n\r\n### Environmental Settings\r\n\r\nThere are three environments provided by default, __development__, __test__, and __production__. Each of these environments has the following configuration options:\r\n* db - This is the name of the MongoDB database to use, and is set by default to __mean-dev__ for the development environment.\r\n* root - This is determined automatically at the start of this file, but can be overridden here.\r\n* app.name - This is the name of your app or website, and can be different for each environment. You can tell which environment you are running by looking at the TITLE attribute that your app generates.\r\n* Social Registration - Facebook, GitHub, Google, Twitter. You can specify your own social accounts here for each social platform, with the following for each provider:\r\n\t* clientID\r\n\t* clientSecret\r\n\t* callbackURL\r\n\r\nTo run with a different environment, just specify NODE_ENV as you call grunt:\r\n\r\n\t$ NODE_ENV=test grunt\r\n\r\nIf you are using node instead of grunt, it is very similar:\r\n\r\n\t$ NODE_ENV=test node server\r\n\r\n> NOTE: Running Node.js applications in the __production__ environment enables caching, which is disabled by default in all other environments.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n  We pre-included an article example, check it out:\r\n  * [The Model](app/models/article.js) - Where we define our object schema.\r\n  * [The Controller](app/controllers/articles.js) - Where we take care of our backend logic.\r\n  * [NodeJS Routes](config/routes.js) - Where we define our REST service routes.\r\n  * [AngularJs Routes](public/js/config.js) - Where we define our CRUD routes.\r\n  * [The AngularJs Service](public/js/services/articles.js) - Where we connect to our REST service.\r\n  * [The AngularJs Controller](public/js/controllers/articles.js) - Where we take care of  our frontend logic.\r\n  * [The AngularJs Views Folder](public/views/articles) - Where we keep our CRUD views.\r\n\r\n## MEAN Modules\r\n   Mean presents a growing eco-system of MEAN based modules in the npm repository, To write (and contribute) your own MEAN based module checkout [mean-logger](https://npmjs.org/package/mean-logger) for examples.\r\n  \r\n## More Information\r\n\r\n  * Visit our [Ninja's Zone](http://www.meanleanstartupmachine.com/) for extended support.\r\n  * Visit us at [Linnovate.net](http://www.linnovate.net/).\r\n  * Contact amos on any issue via [E-Mail](mailto:mail@amoshaviv.com), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/amoshaviv), or [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/amoshaviv).\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\nInspired by the great work of [Madhusudhan Srinivasa](https://github.com/madhums/)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n","google":"UA-36499287-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
